# Optimization of Graph Neural Networks with Natural Gradient Descent

This repository contains the implementaion of the [Optimization of Graph Neural Networks with Natural Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09624). Most of the code is adapted from [github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) and [github.com/Thrandis/EKFAC-pytorch](https://github.com/Thrandis/EKFAC-pytorch).

- Clone the repository and change your current directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/russellizadi/ssp
cd ssp
```
- Create a new 'conda' environment using the default 'environment.yml':
```
